# Lua 5.3.6 online

**[https://rodiongork.github.io/lua-online/](https://rodiongork.github.io/lua-online/)**

Lua sandbox based on jor1k OpenRISC linux emulator.

I just have taken [Lua 5.3.6 source](https://www.lua.org/source/) and compiled it in [Jor1k emulator](https://s-macke.github.io/jor1k/demos/main.html),
then used stripped "demo" version provided by `jor1k` to construct this smaller setup, able to run **lua** in the browser.
